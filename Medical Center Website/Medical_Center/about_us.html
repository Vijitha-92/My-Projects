		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<h3>Our Practice</h3>
 			 <p>Our doctors want to prevent illness and provide immunisation services for your children's wellbeing, flu shots for the winter, vaccine for shingles (free for people aged 70 to 79) and catch-up vaccinations for adults.</p>  
			 <p>We are also accredited to provide travel health advice and vaccines including Yellow Fever. If you are planning a trip overseas please seek our advice.</p>

			 <p>We are able to provide assistance for most minor injuries and accidents.  Our nurses work closely with the doctors in all aspects of patient care. They offer skills in wound care management, immunisation services and ongoing support for people with chronic medical problems.</p>

			 <p>Our other services include family planning, skin cancer checks, menopause counselling and work cover supervision. We also provide emergency care for Urunga, Raleigh, Repton and neighbouring valleys within the shire.</p>

			 <p>Urgent cases will be seen on the day, by the first available doctor (this may not necessarily be your usual doctor), or referred to the doctor on call at the hospital if our emergency appointments have already been taken.</p>

			<p>We endeavour to provide an efficient service with minimal waiting time although sometimes medical emergencies can result in unpredictable delays.  We would invite you to be aware of others needs at these times.</p>

			 <p>For repeat prescriptions or pathology results, please contact our friendly reception staff to book an appointment.</p>
			<p>All patient information is strictly confidential.</p>
			<h3>After hours</h3>
			<p>Our doctors share in an after hours roster. Emergency care is provided through the District Hospital, please phone 02 665 5890 or 000 in an emergency.</p>

			<h3>Telephone calls</h3>
			<p>When doctors are with other patients phone messages will be taken, however emergencies will be given priority.  Doctors will attend to patient messages as soon as possible.</p>

			<h3>Fees</h3>
			<p>Payment is expected at time of consultation. Concession card holders, DVA patients and children under 16 year of age will be bulk billed. Please note, a fee may be charged for missed appointments.</p>
